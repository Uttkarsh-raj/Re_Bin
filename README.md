  There are many great README templates available on GitHub;however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this one. I wanted to create a README template which satisfies the project.
  
Here's why:

- A project that solves a problem and helps others.
- One shouldn't be doing the same task over and over like creating a README from scratch.
- You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So i'll be  adding more in the near future.You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

<!--About the Project-->
  
## About The Project

Re-Bin is an application in which you can donate your remaining food and if the food is edible it will be donated to an NGO and if it is inedible it is used to make compost to increase the fertility of land for the farmers.The more you donate the more you will be getting rewards points. These reward points can be redeemed later.

which sets up a default application setup automatically. To create a project, run the followingf command in cmd after downloading and sucessfully installing flutter:

### Prerequisites

In the main file try running with the run without debugging:
